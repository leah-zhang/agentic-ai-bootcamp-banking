# Transforming Banking with Intelligent Agents - Lab

Lab instructions can be found in the [Lab Instructions](/Lab%20Instuctions/) folder, and scroll down.

# Reminders:

1. This is a shared lab environment, so you will be able to see each other's agents and tools. To avoid duplicated agents, please add your initials to your agents' names.   
Example:

    ```GFM Teller Agent LZ```

2. You are each assigned a unique IBAN account number to avoid conflicting with each other while testing. Your account number is located in the [assigned_accounts.csv](./assigned_accounts.csv) file. Copy this IBAN number and use it for testing your agents as instructed in the lab.
